Python Probabilistic Robotics (ProbRob)
by Chris Murphy

This package provides an implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF),
Particle Filter (PF), and Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) in Python.
The implementations are designed for ease-of-use and ease-of-understanding
rather than speed, and no profiling has yet been done.

Both matplotlib and numpy are required to use the code.

To get started, install the package by running:
 'python setup.py install'

Then, copy the "examples" directory someplace and start your exploration there!

Please submit any bugs or feature requests using the launchpad page at:

Thanks to:
 * Professor John Leonard of MIT, for sharing the example dataset included.
 * Burak Bayramli for bringing the switch from pylab.load to numpy.loadtxt to my attention.
